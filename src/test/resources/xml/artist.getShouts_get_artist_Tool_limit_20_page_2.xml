    <body>Anyway, what's the deal with Tewl not re-issuing GÆynima and 10'000 Gays on vinyl for me to buy immediately? Underblow, Nopiate, and Faperalus (&lt;-multiple times) have all been reissued.</body>

    <body>&quot;Sounds of Maynard Chanting 11 and Stepping On Grapes (In The Fibbernachi Sequence)&quot; will surely be a classic Tool album. A single 71 minute long track, it's been promised to live up to Tool classics like Ions, Viginti Tres, Lipan Conjuring, and Useful Idiot (dedicated to all the people who actually buy Tool records).</body>

    <body>yeah it's totally the most respectable tribute to the inventors of the drop D tuning, if it wasn't for soundgarden, i doubt anyone would have had the idea to down tune their E string</body>
