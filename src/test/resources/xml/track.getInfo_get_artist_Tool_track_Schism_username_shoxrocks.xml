        <content><![CDATA[&quot;<a title="Tool &ndash; Schism" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/_/Schism" class="bbcode_track">Schism</a>&quot; is a song by American alternative metal / progressive metal band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tool" class="bbcode_artist">Tool</a>. It was the first single and music video from their third full-length album, <a title="Tool - Lateralus" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tool/Lateralus" class="bbcode_album">Lateralus</a>. In 2002, Tool won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for the song.  &quot;Schism&quot; was released as a DVD single on December 20, 2005. The DVD contains the music video, dual-commentary by David Yow, and a remix by Lustmord.  &quot;Schism&quot; is known as a prime example of Tool's use of complex rhythms and changing meters. An extended version of the song is performed live.  <strong>Song meter</strong> A possible analysis of the meter changes is found in the August 2001 issue of Guitar One magazine. As transcribed by Adam Perlmutter, the song starts in 5/4 for one measure followed by 21 measures of 6/4 (or 5/8 and 7/8 alternating), up to the first interlude, which is a bar of 3/8, three bars of 13/8, and a bar of 10/8. (This can be also interpreted as four 13/8 bars, but played with a 3/8 upbeat.) The next verse is eight bars of 6/4 followed by another interlude that fits the same pattern as the first. The next section is four bars of 6/4 followed by one bar of 11/8. Another eight-bar verse in 6/4 follows, with an interlude containing the same as before, except the final 10/8 bar is replaced with an 11/8 bar setting up the middle section, which is four bars of 7/4 before settling into a pattern of alternating 12/8 and 15/8, one bar each, twelve times. Following this, there are three bars of 4/4, a bar of 2/4, and four bars of 4/4 setting up another section, which is two bars of 9/8 followed by a bar of 10/8, that pattern again, a single bar of 9/8 followed by a 13/8 bar. This leads to an alternating set of 9/8 and 5/8, appearing four times before a bar of 9/8 and a bar of 6/8. Near the end, there is a 6/4 meter for eight bars, followed by eight bars of 4/4 to end the song. In all, the song changes meters 47 times. The band has comically said that the song is in &quot;6.5/8&quot;.
