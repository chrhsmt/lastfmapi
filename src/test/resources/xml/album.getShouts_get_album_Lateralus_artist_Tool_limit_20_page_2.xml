    <body>But still, the black cover is not the actual ARTWORK. It's just a clever way to avoid putting logo and album title in the artwork.</body>

    <body>V But the black one is more than just packaging. It has the band logo, the album title, the track listings, all of which isn't even visible in the CD artwork, so you need the album sleeve if you're gonna own the original CD. That makes it pretty obvious that it was intended to be the front cover of the album.</body>

    <body>Nope, this is the actual cover. The black one is just packaging. If you had an original cd, you would know.</body>

    <body>I don't believe in any other order other than what is on the CD. The vinyl order is rearanged too because of timing. If Disposition doesn't flow into Reflection, something is WRONG. Period.</body>

    <body>I don't know if that &quot;secret order&quot; is correct, but it's better than original order in my humble opinion. :-)</body>

    <body>&quot;Just because track 11 leads into 12 does not discount the possibility it leads in/out of another.&quot; But it leads into EXACTLY THE SAME SOUND lol. Not to mention the sound is cut off and then continues from where it was cut in the next track. I'm talking about the last very seconds of Reflection, turn your volume up for fucks sake.</body>

    <body>Logically speaking, just because track 11 leads into 12 does not discount the possibility it leads in/out of another. Also, its common for music videos to use the end of the previous track for context or introduction. Therefore your argument does not remove the possibility of an intended alternate track order.</body>

    <body>At the end of track 11 you can hear the beginning of track 12. and in the music video of track 5 you can hear track 4 as intro. So gtfo with your retarded theory, there's no secret order.</body>
